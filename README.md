# Imperator Rome BBR Music Mod

This mod adds close to 100 new music tracks on top of the vanilla ones. Sources include:
- Europa Universalis: Rome
- Rome Total War
- Rome II Total War
- Attila Total War
- Total War Saga Thrones of Brittania

All tracks are hand picked by me and are mostly ancient-style European ambient tracks with a few oriental ones. To my knowledge, Imperator does not support culture-specific music like some of the older Paradox titles so playing in India might be a bit immersion breaking.

I did not include any battle tracks as I don't believe they are suitable to the chill grand strategy experience and to Imperator Rome's ambiance.

Should be compatible with any mods except other music mods. This mod is based on the original music mod by Paradox: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1929682011

All rights to this beautiful music belong to their legal owners, not me. This is just a collection to enhance the game experience.
